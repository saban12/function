//  Function expression that assigns the function displayFavorite 
//  to the variable favoriteMovie
var favoriteMovie = function displayFavorite(movieName) {
    console.log("My favorite movie is " + movieName);
  };
  
  // Function declaration that has two parameters: a function for displaying
  // a message, along with a name of a movie
  function movies(messageFunction, name) {
    messageFunction(name);
  }
  
  // Call the movies function, pass in the favoriteMovie function and name of movie
  movies(favoriteMovie, "Finding Nemo");


// But you could have bypassed the first assignment of the function, by passing the function to the movies() function inline.

// Function declaration that takes in two arguments: a function for displaying
// a message, along with a name of a movie
function movies(messageFunction, name) {
  messageFunction(name);
}

// Call the movies function, pass in the function and name of movie
movies(function displayFavorite(movieName) {
  console.log("My favorite movie is " + movieName);
}, "Finding Nemo");

//This type of syntax, writing function expressions that pass a function into another function inline, is really common in JavaScript. 
//It can be a little tricky at first, but be patient, keep practicing, and you'll start to get the hang of it!
